This repository is the code used for my year 12 mathematical modelling of a 2015 AFL season.
It has a converter for data from https://australianfootball.com/seasons/season/afl/138/premiership%2Bseason/1/1/2015/advanced so I don't have to make all the r1,r2,r3.txt files manually. 

If math teacher is reading this, feel free to ask me any time for live demos, you can also clone the repository (here is a guide on how to https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/clone-a-git-repository/). I have included a lot of screenshots and pseudocode explaining the code so this step won't be necessary for assessment should you not wish to. You can also just view the code here :))
