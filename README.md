# GlickoBetting
This is the code used for my 12th grade maths assignment. The task was to model a sports league season to predict outcomes of matches.

### Rationale
I didn't like doing repetitive calculations so I made a python script as my assignment submission.
It converts copy-pasted data from [here](https://australianfootball.com/seasons/season/afl/138/premiership%2Bseason/1/1/2015/advanced) to the .txt format used. My model uses the glicko system. There are existing (much more efficient) libraries of the models but I'm graded on mathematics not ability-to-use-libraries. 

For my math teacher: feel free to ask me any time for live demos, if interested you can run it on your own machine, [This is how to download the code] (https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/clone-a-git-repository/). I have included a lot of screenshots and pseudocode explanations in my report so this isn't necessary for grading.
